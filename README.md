# The Alvian Zachry Faturrahman Portfolio Experience™

> *Warning: Contains excessive amounts of "Regional Manager" energy and mathematically generated worms. Proceed with caution.*

Hi, I'm **Alvian Zachry**. I collect job titles like other people collect Pokémon cards (Program Manager, Technical Lead, Full Stack Engineer, Talent Acquisition Specialist... look, I just really like working, okay?).

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a **React-Vite-TypeScript-Tailwind-FramerMotion** masterpiece that I built to make myself feel better about all the `create-react-app` projects I abandoned in 2019.

## 🌟 "Awesome" Features (That I Definitely Needed)

### 🪱 The "Worm" Background
You noticed the squiggly lines? I call them "Worms."
*   **What it does:** I use complex Bézier curves (`Q` commands, because I'm fancy) and `Math.random()` to generate floating squiggles.
*   **Why?** Because a static white background is for people who don't know how to abuse their CPU.
*   **Tech Spec:** It renders **50** independent SVG paths that fade in and out. Yes, I am personally responsible for your laptop fan spinning up right now. You're welcome.

### 🎭 The Infinite Skill Marquee
One static list of skills wasn't enough to contain my professional ego. I needed an honest-to-god **Infinite CSS Marquee**.
*   It scrolls left.
*   It scrolls right.
*   It pauses on hover (so you can carefully read "CodeIgniter" and wonder what year I think it is).
*   **Contains:** Everything from "NestJS" to "Project Management." If it's a buzzword, I put it in there.

### 🔥 "Get Roasted" Mentorship
I made an entire page dedicated to **roasting you**.
*   I will manually tear apart your interview skills.
*   I call it "Brutally Honest Feedback" because "Professional Criticism" sounded too boring.
*   Finally, a service for people who think LeetCode isn't painful enough.

### 🤖 SEO & AIO (Feeding the Robot Overlords)
I didn't just add meta tags; I performed a ritual summoning for the search engine bots.
*   **Dynamic Blogger API Integration**: I wrote a Node.js script that literally fetches data from the **Blogger API** to generate my XML sitemap. Yes, I use Blogger. STOP LAUGHING. It works.
*   **JSON-LD Schema**: I injected structured data so Google's AI knows *exactly* who I am. I am feeding the basilisk directly.
*   **OpenGraph**: My links look so good on Slack that my coworkers might actually click them for once.

## 🔧 Under The Hood (How I Over-Engineered This)

I built this app with a stack that says "I have too much free time."

*   **Vite**: Because waiting more than 100ms for a local server start is a personal insult to me.
*   **React 19**: I'm on the bleeding edge. If it breaks, it's a "feature."
*   **TypeScript**: Because I realized `any` is a sin (mostly).
*   **Framer Motion**: Used everywhere. If an element enters the DOM without a specialized dance routine, did it really render?
*   **Tailwind CSS**: 50 utility classes in one `className` string. Readability is subjective.
*   **React Helmet Async**: Managing document heads asynchronously because I live in the future.

## 🏃 How to Run My Masterpiece

If you truly want to run this locally and see my worms wiggle on your own localhost:

```bash
# Install the entire internet
npm install

# Summon the worms
npm run dev

# Generate the sitemap (and expose my Blogger secrets)
npm run generate-sitemap
```
